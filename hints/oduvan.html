        I have no idea how to start solving this mission

    <div class="answer">
        Your general strategy here is to split string by words and then get the first one.

        Ok, maybe some doc links?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Sure, if you need to split string, you should do <b>str.split</b>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/stdtypes.html#str.split">Read more about it in docs</a>.

    <div class="question">
        Ok, how can I get words now?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Well, actually, by colling this function. Check this out

        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "greeting from CheckiO Planet"
words = text.split()
print(words)
        </pre>

        output for this piece of code will be 

        <pre class="brush: python">
['greeting', 'from', 'CheckiO', 'Planet']
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Well, how can I get the first word then?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        So, the result of <b>split</b> function is a list of words. In order to get the first one you need to use index 0.
        <pre class="brush: python">
print(words[0])
        </pre>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        Still don't know how to put all of this together.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        So your final solution should looks like this:
        <pre class="brush: python">
def first_word(text: str) -> str:
    """
        returns the first word in a given text.
    """
    return text.split()[0]
        </pre>

    </div>
</div>
